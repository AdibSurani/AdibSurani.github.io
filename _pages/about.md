My full name is Muhammad Adib bin Surani, but [Malay names](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysian_names) can get very confusing so I often present myself as Adib Surani. I've been married for fourteen years, with three wonderful kids, the youngest of whom, Maria, has [Rett syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rett_syndrome). She's actually my inspiration for starting this website.

I am a mathematician, puzzle hunter, and CTF player. In the puzzle world I'm usually just Adib, but in the hacking scene (be it CTF or game translation), I typically go by the pseudonym Neobeo. This separation was made back when I was younger and anonymity seemed like an important thing. But nowadays it's just a hassle to have e.g. two github accounts.

The best way to contact me is via email or on discord. I am pretty much inactive on all other social media.
